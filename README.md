## Summarize
The company ”Pricotercorp S.A.” has a wide variety of items such as video games and
comics, which are currently inventoried in Excel. A software system with two modules
is needed, one exclusively for company workers and the other for customer use.

First, there is an inventory that contains all the details of the products such as stock,
price, name, and code (id) in order to streamline the inventory update process. On the 
other hand, there is a web page that shows all the available products from each store by city;
moreover, customers will be able to view the details of the aforementioned products except 
for the code of each product so that customers can reserve a product of interest.
